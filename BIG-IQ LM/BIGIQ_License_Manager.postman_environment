IF LICENSEE DOES NOT AGREE, DO NOT INSTALL OR \\r\\nUSE THE PRODUCT.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n1.\\tScope.  This End User License Agreement (\\\"License\\\") applies to the \\r\\nsoftware product (\\\"Software\\\") Licensee has licensed from F5.  All \\r\\nreferences to \\\"F5\\\" in this License will be deemed to be a reference to \\r\\nthe applicable F5 entity as follows: (i) if Licensee's primary place of \\r\\nbusiness is located in the European Economic Area, the Middle East or \\r\\nAfrica (\\\"EMEA\\\"), the F5 entity is F5 Networks Ltd.; (ii) if Licensee's \\r\\nprimary place of business is located in the Asia-Pacific region, \\r\\nexcluding Japan, India and Taiwan (\\\"APAC\\\"), the F5 entity is F5 \\r\\nNetworks Singapore Pte Ltd; and (iii) if Licensee's primary place of \\r\\nbusiness is located in Japan, India, Taiwan or a region outside of EMEA \\r\\nor APAC, the F5 entity is F5 Networks, Inc. Certain Software is \\r\\nlicensed for use in conjunction with F5 hardware which together with \\r\\nthe Software will be referenced as the \\\"Product.\\\" This License is a \\r\\nlegal agreement between F5 and the single entity (\\\"Licensee\\\") that has \\r\\nacquired the Software from F5 under these terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\tLicense Grant.  Subject to the terms of this License, F5 grants to \\r\\nLicensee a non-exclusive, non- transferable license to use the Software \\r\\nduring the term for which Licensee has paid the required license fees \\r\\nin object code form for Licensee's internal business purposes.  Other \\r\\nthan as specifically described herein, no right or license is granted \\r\\nto any of F5's trademarks, patents, copyrights, or other intellectual \\r\\nproperty rights and F5 retains all rights not granted herein.  The \\r\\nSoftware incorporates certain third party software, which is used \\r\\nsubject to licenses from the respective owners.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLicensee understands that by using the Product, Licensee consents and \\r\\nagrees to the collection and use of certain information about \\r\\nLicensee's Product, including but not limited to hardware serial \\r\\nnumber, appliance part number, disk configuration, memory amount, as \\r\\nwell as periodic updates for software, databases, etc.  Licensee \\r\\nfurther consents and agrees that the Product may collect, use, transmit \\r\\nto F5, process and maintain information related to the Product for \\r\\npurposes of providing the Software, and any features therein. \\r\\nInformation collected by the Product and transmitted to F5 may also \\r\\ninclude technical or diagnostic information related to Licensee's use \\r\\nthat may be used by F5 to support, improve and enhance F5's products \\r\\nand services. Licensee may opt out of the collection and use of such \\r\\ninformation by configuring the Product to disable these features.  \\r\\n\\r\\n3.\\tRestrictions.  \\r\\n\\r\\n(a)\\tThe Software, documentation and the associated copyrights and other \\r\\nintellectual property rights are owned by F5 or its licensors and are \\r\\nprotected by law and international treaties.  Licensee may not copy or \\r\\ntranslate the documentation provided with the Software or available \\r\\nonline at http://askf5.com (\\\"Documentation\\\") without F5's prior, \\r\\nwritten consent.  Licensee may install, use, access, display and run \\r\\nthe Software only in the manner in which it has been licensed as \\r\\nindicated herein and in the applicable purchase order, quote or the \\r\\nlicense file for such Product or Software, including but not limited to \\r\\nany restrictions on number of protected applications, number or type of \\r\\nlicensed devices, number of authorized copies or instances, number of \\r\\nusers, bandwidth, non-production use, database or location \\r\\nrestrictions.  Licensee further agrees that it will not defeat, \\r\\ncircumvent or disable any copy protection mechanism or mechanism in the \\r\\nSoftware used to limit license duration or access to non-licensed \\r\\nfunctionality or capacity, and that any such attempt will be a material \\r\\nbreach of this Agreement.  F5 reserves the right to audit Licensee's \\r\\nuse of the Software or authorize others to conduct such an audit on its \\r\\nbehalf and to disable any application or functionality that has not \\r\\nbeen specifically licensed, in addition to any other rights and \\r\\nremedies available to F5.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(b)\\tFor Software modules purchased in conjunction with a F5 device, the \\r\\nSoftware is not transferable to other F5 devices or third party \\r\\nhardware.  For Software provided in stand-alone form (not embedded in a \\r\\nF5 hardware Product), Licensee may only install and use  the Software \\r\\nin  object code form  on the server(s) for which  Licensee has a valid \\r\\nlicense  key issued to it by F5 or its authorized sub-licensor and only \\r\\nfor the duration of the validity of such license key.  The use of any \\r\\nhardware or software to pool resources or reduce the number of devices \\r\\nthat directly access or use the Software (sometimes referred to as \\r\\n'virtualization') will not reduce the number of license keys required. \\r\\nLicensee must have a separate license key for each instance of the \\r\\nSoftware. F5 may restrict Licensee's use of the Software, by at least \\r\\none of the following locking methods: (i) an instance identifier; (ii) \\r\\nhypervisor in use; (iii) a bridge; and/or (iv) Media Access Control \\r\\n(MAC) address. Licensee agrees that it will not attempt to circumvent \\r\\nany of the foregoing license key restrictions or to have others do so \\r\\non its behalf. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(c)\\tCertain portions of the Software include third party software \\r\\nmodules, which may include, but are not limited to, MySQL licensed \\r\\nfrom MySQL AB or JavaTM licensed from Oracle America, Inc., and \\r\\nare subject to additional limitations imposed by those third parties \\r\\n(\\\"Restricted Third Party Software\\\").  Certain portions of the Software \\r\\nmay also include geographical or other data (\\\"Data\\\").  Licensee agrees \\r\\nthat it will only use such Restricted Third Party Software or Data in \\r\\nconjunction with the Product and not as standalone software. Licensee \\r\\nwill not (i) copy the Restricted Third Party Software or Data onto any \\r\\npublic or distributed network; (ii) use the Restricted Third Party \\r\\nSoftware or Data separately to operate in or as a time-sharing, \\r\\noutsourcing, service bureau, application service provider or managed \\r\\nservice provider environment; (iii) use the Restricted Third Party \\r\\nSoftware or Data as a general server, as a standalone application or \\r\\nwith applications other than the Software under this license; (iv) \\r\\nchange any proprietary rights notices which appear in the Restricted \\r\\nThird Party Software or Data; or (v) modify the Restricted Third Party \\r\\nSoftware or Data.  The protections given to F5 under this License also \\r\\napply to the suppliers of this third party software.  \\r\\n\\r\\n(d)\\tLicensee may \\r\\nnot copy (except to make one archival copy for backup and disaster \\r\\nrecover purposes), modify, sell, sub-license, rent or transfer the \\r\\nSoftware, Data or any associated Documentation to any third party.  \\r\\nLicensee may not disassemble, reverse compile or reverse engineer the \\r\\nSoftware or any Data incorporated in the Software or encourage others \\r\\nto do so except as required by law for interoperability purposes, and \\r\\nthen only after Licensee has given Supplier an opportunity to provide \\r\\ninformation or software necessary to resolve such interoperability \\r\\nissues. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4.\\tExport Control.  F5's standard Product incorporates cryptographic \\r\\nsoftware.  Licensee agrees to comply with the Export Administration \\r\\nAct, the Export Control Act, all regulations promulgated under such \\r\\nActs, and all other US government regulations relating to the export of \\r\\ntechnical data and equipment and products produced therefrom which are \\r\\napplicable to Licensee.  In countries other than the US, Licensee \\r\\nagrees to comply with the local regulations regarding importing, \\r\\nexporting or using cryptographic software. Licensee agrees it will not \\r\\nexport or re-export the Software to any country, person, or entity \\r\\nsubject to U.S. export restrictions. Specifically, Licensee agrees not \\r\\nto export or re-export the Software: (i) to any country to which the \\r\\nU.S. has embargoed or restricted the export of goods or services, or to \\r\\nany national of any such country, wherever located, who intends to \\r\\ntransmit or transport the Software back to such country; (ii) to any \\r\\nperson or entity who Licensee knows or has reason to know will utilize \\r\\nthe Software or portion thereof in the design, development or \\r\\nproduction of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; or (iii) to any \\r\\nperson or entity who has been prohibited from participating in U.S. \\r\\nexport transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government, \\r\\nincluding but not limited to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's \\r\\nlist of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of \\r\\nCommerce's Table of Denial Orders. By installing or using the Software, \\r\\nLicensee represents and warrants that it is not located in, under \\r\\ncontrol of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any \\r\\nsuch list.  \\r\\n\\r\\n5.\\tLimited Warranty.  F5 warrants that for a period of 90 \\r\\ndays from the date of shipment:  (i) the media on which the Software is \\r\\nfurnished will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under \\r\\nnormal use; and (ii) the Software substantially conforms to its \\r\\npublished specifications.  Except for the foregoing, the Software is \\r\\nprovided AS IS.  In no event does F5 warrant that the Software is error \\r\\nfree, that it will operate with any software or hardware other than \\r\\nthat provided by F5 or specified in the documentation, or that the \\r\\nSoftware will satisfy Licensee's own specific requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(a)\\tRemedy.  Licensee's exclusive remedy under this limited warranty is \\r\\nthat F5, at F5's option, will repair or replace any Software that fails \\r\\nduring the warranty period at no cost to Licensee.  F5 will replace \\r\\ndefective media or documentation or, at its option, undertake \\r\\nreasonable efforts to modify the Software to correct any substantial \\r\\nnon-conformance with the specifications.  \\r\\n\\r\\n(b)\\tRestrictions.  The foregoing limited warranties extend only to the \\r\\noriginal Licensee, and do not apply if the Software (i) has been \\r\\naltered, except by F5 or an F5-designated representative or in \\r\\naccordance with F5 instructions, (ii) has not been installed, operated, \\r\\nrepaired, or maintained in accordance with F5's instructions, (iii) has \\r\\nbeen subjected to abnormal physical or electrical stress, misuse, \\r\\nnegligence or accident or (iv) has been operated outside of the \\r\\nenvironmental specifications for the Software.  F5's limited software \\r\\nwarranty does not apply to software corrections or upgrades. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6.\\tNotice to U.S. Government End Users.  The Software and \\r\\nDocumentation qualify as \\\"commercial items,\\\" as that term is defined at \\r\\nFederal Acquisition Regulation (\\\"FAR\\\") (48 C.F.R.) 2.101, consisting of \\r\\n\\\"commercial computer software\\\" and \\\"commercial computer software \\r\\ndocumentation\\\" as such terms are used in FAR 12.212.  Consistent with \\r\\nFAR 12.212 and DoD FAR Supp. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, and \\r\\nnotwithstanding any other FAR or other contractual clause to the \\r\\ncontrary in any agreement into which this End User License Agreement \\r\\nmay be incorporated, Licensee may provide to Government end user or, if \\r\\nthis Agreement is direct, Government end user will acquire, the \\r\\nSoftware and Documentation with only those rights set forth in this End \\r\\nUser License Agreement. Use of either the Software or Documentation or \\r\\nboth constitutes agreement by the Government that the Software and \\r\\nDocumentation are \\\"commercial computer software\\\" and \\\"commercial \\r\\ncomputer software documentation\\\" and constitutes acceptance of the \\r\\nrights and restrictions herein.  \\r\\n\\r\\n7.\\tDISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF REMEDY.  EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES \\r\\nSPECIFICALLY DESCRIBED HEREIN, F5 AND ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS \\r\\nDISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND GUARANTEES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR \\r\\nOTHERWISE, ARISING, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, DATA, SPECIFICATIONS, \\r\\nOR DOCUMENTATION DELIVERED HEREUNDER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE \\r\\nWARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT OR TITLE AND \\r\\nTHE WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  F5 MAKES NO WARRANTY \\r\\nCONCERNING THE COMPLETENESS OR ACCURACY OF THE DATA OR INFORMATION \\r\\nOBTAINED OR DERIVED THROUGH THE USE OF THE DATA INCLUDED IN THE \\r\\nSOFTWARE AND THE DATA IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\".  F5 HAS NOT AUTHORIZED \\r\\nANYONE TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OTHER THAN AS PROVIDED \\r\\nABOVE OR TO OTHERWISE MODIFY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE COLLECTIVE \\r\\nLIABILITY OF F5 AND ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS UNDER THIS LICENSE FOR \\r\\nPERPETUAL LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE \\r\\nSOFTWARE.  THE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY OF F5 AND ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS \\r\\nUNDER THIS LICENSE FOR  SOFTWARE OTHER THAN PERPETUAL LICENSED SOFTWARE \\r\\nWILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE IN THE TWELVE (12) \\r\\nMONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.  F5 AND ITS THIRD \\r\\nPARTY LICENSORS WILL NOT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY, WHETHER \\r\\nARISING IN CONTRACT (INCLUDING WARRANTY), TORT (INCLUDING ACTIVE, \\r\\nPASSIVE OR IMPUTED NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR PRODUCT LIABILITY) \\r\\nOR OTHERWISE FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, \\r\\nCONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF \\r\\nUSE, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF \\r\\nBUSINESS OR OTHER FINANCIAL LOSS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH \\r\\nTHE SOFTWARE OR OTHER GOODS OR SERVICES FURNISHED TO LICENSEE BY F5, \\r\\nEVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT \\r\\nPERMITTED BY LAW, F5's THIRD PARTY LICENSORS WILL NOT HAVE ANY \\r\\nLIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER THIS LICENSE \\r\\nAGREEMENT.  THE LIMITATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY \\r\\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF AN ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED \\r\\nREMEDY PROVIDED UNDER ANY TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT.  SOME JURISDICTIONS \\r\\nDO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR \\r\\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS, SUCH INAPPLICABILITY \\r\\nWILL NOT AFFECT THE REMAINDER OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS SECTION.  \\r\\n\\r\\n8.\\tNon-Production Use Software.  If Licensee purchases an F5 Product \\r\\nor licenses F5 Software designated as \\\"non-production,\\\" \\r\\n\\\"non-commercial,\\\" \\\"lab\\\" or \\\"development\\\" Product in the applicable \\r\\npurchase order, quote or the license file for such Product or Software \\r\\n(\\\"Non-Production Software\\\"), Licensee may use the Software included \\r\\nwith such Product to conduct testing and development in Licensee's \\r\\nnon-production environment only and not to manage data traffic or \\r\\napplications in the ordinary course of Licensee's business.    Licensee \\r\\nagrees that any use of Non-Production Software in violation of the \\r\\npreceding sentence is a material breach of this Agreement.  \\r\\n\\r\\n9.\\tEvaluation Software.  If the Software is \\\"Evaluation Software,\\\" \\r\\nnotwithstanding any other terms to the contrary in this Agreement, \\r\\nLicensee may use the Software only for its internal demonstration, test \\r\\nor evaluation purposes and not in a production environment.  \\r\\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERMS TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS LICENSE, F5 DISCLAIMS \\r\\nALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, FOR EVALUATION SOFTWARE AND IT IS \\r\\nPROVIDED ON AN \\\"AS IS\\\" BASIS. EVALUATION SOFTWARE HAS A NON-PERPETUAL \\r\\nTIME LIMITED LICENSE THAT WILL \\\"TIME-OUT\\\" AND DISABLE THE SOFTWARE UPON \\r\\nEXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD.

Licensee agrees it will not transfer any part of the \\r\\nSoftware out of the Cloud Provider's environment.  Licensee may use \\r\\nmultiple instances of the same Software in object code format in the \\r\\nCloud Provider's environment, paying for each instance separately. IN \\r\\nADDITION TO THE DISCLAIMERS SET FORTH IN SECTION 7 ABOVE, AND \\r\\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERMS TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS LICENSE OR ANY \\r\\nREPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF THE APPLICABLE CLOUD OR SIMILAR \\r\\nENVIRONMENT, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\" AND POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS.  \\r\\n\\r\\n11.\\tTermination.  The license granted in Section 2 is effective until \\r\\nterminated and will automatically terminate if Licensee fails to comply \\r\\nwith any of the terms and conditions set forth herein.  Upon \\r\\ntermination, Licensee will destroy the Software and documentation and \\r\\nall copies or portions thereof.  \\r\\n\\r\\n12.\\tSupport.  Maintenance and support of the Software is not provided \\r\\nunder this License and must be purchased separately subject to F5's \\r\\nsupport policies available at \\r\\nhttp://www.f5.com/about/guidelines-policies/ and http://askf5.com   \\r\\nWhere Licensee has purchased maintenance and support for a Product, the \\r\\nterm Software under this License will include any published updates, \\r\\ncorrections, new releases and new versions of such Software \\r\\n(collectively \\\"Updates\\\"), provided that Licensee is otherwise entitled \\r\\nto access and use such Updates pursuant to the applicable maintenance \\r\\nand support contract.  Licensee may only use the Updates on Products \\r\\nfor which Licensee is the original end user or other Products which \\r\\ninclude Software to which Licensee holds a valid license, and only on \\r\\nequipment for which Licensee has purchased maintenance and support.  \\r\\nPermissible upgrades for virtual edition licenses are further described \\r\\nat http://support.f5.com/kb/en- \\r\\nus/solutions/public/15000/600/sol15643.html.  \\r\\n\\r\\n13.\\tMiscellaneous.  This License will be governed and construed in \\r\\naccordance with the following governing law (\\\"Governing Law\\\"), \\r\\ndepending on the applicable licensing F5 entity, without regard to its \\r\\nchoice of law rules:  \\r\\n\\r\\nLocation: F5 Networks Singapore Pte Ltd \\r\\nGoverning Law: The laws of Singapore \\r\\nVenue: Singapore \\r\\n\\r\\nLocation: F5 Networks Ltd. \\r\\nGoverning Law: The laws of England and Wales \\r\\nVenue: London England \\r\\n\\r\\nLocation: F5 Networks, Inc. \\r\\nGoverning Law: The laws of the State of Washington \\r\\nVenue: Seattle, Washington   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe provisions of the U.N. Convention for the International Sale of \\r\\nGoods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, in \\r\\nwhatever form adopted, will not apply and the parties specifically opt \\r\\nout of the application of such laws.  In the event of any dispute \\r\\narising out of or relating to this Agreement, the parties shall seek to \\r\\nsettle the dispute via direct discussions.  If a dispute cannot be \\r\\nsettled through direct discussions, the parties agree to first endeavor \\r\\nto settle the dispute via voluntary non-binding mediation, before \\r\\nresorting to arbitration.  A mediator will be selected by voluntary \\r\\nagreement of both parties, or in the event both parties cannot agree on \\r\\na mediator, a mediator will be selected in accordance with the rules of \\r\\nJAMS.  The mediation shall be held in the applicable venue (\\\"Venue\\\") \\r\\nidentified in the chart above.  Each party shall bear its own costs and \\r\\nexpenses and an equal share of the administrative and other fees \\r\\nassociated with the mediation.  Any dispute that remains unresolved \\r\\nfollowing mediation shall be settled by arbitration administered by the \\r\\nJAMS in accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules.  The place \\r\\nof arbitration shall be the applicable Venue.  Judgment upon the award \\r\\nrendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having \\r\\njurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator(s) shall award to the prevailing \\r\\nparty, if any, as determined by the arbitrator(s), all of its costs and \\r\\nfees.  \\\"Costs and fees\\\" mean all reasonable pre-award expenses of the \\r\\narbitration, including the arbitrators' fees, administrative fees, \\r\\ntravel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, \\r\\ncourt costs, witness fees, and attorneys' fees.  In rendering the \\r\\naward, the arbitrator(s) shall determine the rights and obligations of \\r\\nthe parties according to the substantive and procedural laws of the \\r\\napplicable Governing Law.  The foregoing alternative dispute resolution \\r\\nprovisions will not apply to claims or actions related to the \\r\\ninfringement, misappropriation or violation of F5's intellectual \\r\\nproperty rights or those of its third party licensors and such actions \\r\\nmay be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Any provisions \\r\\nfound to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the \\r\\nother provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a \\r\\nprovision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This \\r\\nLicense constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with \\r\\nregard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless \\r\\nin writing and signed by the parties.  \\r\\n\\r\\n14.\\tAcknowledgements.
